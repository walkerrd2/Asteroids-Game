This is an implementation of the classic Asteroids arcade game, created as a Java project. The game features a player-controlled spaceship, asteroids that can be split or destroyed, laser bullets that can be fired from the ship, and a score tracking system and multiple lives. The player starts with 3 ships, which are the lives. If an asteroid hits the ship, the ship is destroyed and a life is lost. When the player loses all 3 lives, or all asteroids are destroyed, the game ends. Shooting the asteroids splits them into smaller pieces then the small asteroids are destroyed when hit by bullets. Points are awarded for destroying asteroids
